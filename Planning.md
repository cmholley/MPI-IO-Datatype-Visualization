##Canvas drawing vs JPanels
If I figure out how to draw properly on the canvas, I can use JavaFX to draw the actual visualization which would be more modern and flexible

A JPanel is simple but not flexible. A for loop that generates a series of VisualizationPanels for the most recent fileview would be easy but potentially limited in flexability
